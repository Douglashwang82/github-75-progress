# Cheatsheet
1. Is sorting the given data helpful? (make sure the original indice is saved)
2. Is hash map helpful?
3. Can a two-pointer approach be used?
4. Are there duplicate values in the input?
5. Is the input size large or small (which affects time complexity)?
6. Can the problem be solved in-place or does it require extra space?
7. Is the input already sorted?
8. Are negative numbers present in the input?
9. Is it necessary to return indices or just the values?
10. Is there only one solution or could there be multiple?
11. Can recursion or backtracking be applied?
12. Are there constraints on time or space complexity?
13. Is the input mutable or immutable?
14. Can dynamic programming be used?
15. Are edge cases (empty input, single element, etc.) handled?
16. Is the solution required to be optimal or is a brute force approach acceptable?
17. Can the problem be reduced to a known algorithm or data structure?
18. Are there any constraints on the range of input values?
19. Is parallel processing or multi-threading applicable?
20. Are there any mathematical properties or patterns
