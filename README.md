# LeetCode Core Algorithms & Data Structures Study Plan

This is a **24-week structured study plan** to master core algorithms and data structures using LeetCode.  
It is divided into **3 stages**: fundamentals, core algorithms, and advanced patterns.

---

## ðŸ“… Study Schedule

### **Stage 1 â€” Core Data Structures (Weeks 1â€“8)**
- Arrays & Strings (Sliding Window, Two Pointers, Prefix Sum)
- Hashing (HashMap, HashSet)
- Stack & Queue (Monotonic Stack, BFS)
- Linked List (Fast & Slow Pointers, In-place Reversal)

### **Stage 2 â€” Core Algorithms (Weeks 9â€“15)**
- Binary Search
- Recursion & Divide and Conquer
- Trees (DFS & BFS)
- Graph Basics (BFS, DFS)

### **Stage 3 â€” Advanced Patterns (Weeks 16â€“24)**
- Dynamic Programming (DP)
- Greedy
- Advanced DP / Graph Algorithms
